This analysis explores the relationship between salary and offensive performance for major league baseball players from 1985 onwards.

Specifically, I looked at how median offensive performance and median salary varied as baseball players aged. Offensive performance was
represented by 'on-base percentage plus slugging' (OPS) widely, regarded as a comprehensive metric for players' offensive production. 
As players aged, salaries would increase at a greater rate than performance, both of which tended to decline markedly after 35. 

I also analyzed trends in median offensive performance and median salary over time from players in the league who had at least 150 at-bats. 
From 1990 to 2000, offensive production increased dramatically, while median salaries also increased, albeit at a slower rate. Subsequently, from 
2000-2015, offensive performance declined while median salaries have continued to climb. 

I decided to explore the relationship between pay and performance further, and tracked the proportion of players who were paid above the 
median salary, but underperformed the median OPS. The percentage of players who were overpaid between 1985 and 2015 increased from nearly 0% at age 20 
to nearly 35% once a player hits his mid 30's. 

Looking at trends throughout the league from 1985 to 2015, the proportion of overpaid players with at least 150 at-bats ranged from 22% to 17%, while
the median age fluctuated between 28 and 30. 

Finally, using a quadrant-based scatter plot for 2015, we were able to identify players who delivered great value relative to pay (paid
under the median salary and performed greater than the median OPS) and those who failed to deliver value.

The analysis was done by joining different excel spreadsheets publicly available from journalist Sean Lehman's baseball database on
